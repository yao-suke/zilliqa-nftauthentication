## The Problem <a name="problem"></a>
The onboarding process for employees at tech companies is a long road of usernames, new email addresses, and passwords across several different internal tools. Even with tools such as Okta and GMail to authenticate employees quickly, this can become a hassle if you're attempting to login to your company accounts on another device(cellphone,tablet,etc.) Also, a third party sits between you and having access to these internal tools often to grant you access - the IT Security Deparment. Can NFTs completely replace this process in companies, allowing for easier authentication to internal tools?
